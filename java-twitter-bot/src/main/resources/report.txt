Report.txt

Design and run a variety of experiments in MatchBot.main() and summarize your results in a text file 
named report.txt that you include with your project. Which of the three algorithms works best on the 
Twitter dataset? What about other kinds of data? Hypothesize about the reasons why one algorithm is 
better suited to a particular type of data. Support your conclusions with evidence.

<----------- Report Analysis -------------->

When analyzing real-time Twitter data, it appears that the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm appears to consume the least amount of character comparisons
when compared to the other two algorithms. I have copied and pasted my console output from my MatchBot.main() testing to highlight the results.

Since the Boyer-Moore string matching has the least amount of character comparisons, it is clear that this is the best algorithm for the Twitter dataset.
What struck me as interesting is that the KMP algorithm actually resulted in more character comparisons than the naive string matching. The only times KMP was
faster than the naive algorithm is when there were repeats in the pattern or text as shown at the bottom with my testPartialRepeat() results.

I think the Boyer-Moore is best suited to any data type due to its ability to make long jumps in the texts. This allows traversing the 140 characters
in a Tweet efficient and quick, eliminating excess character comparisons. The KMP is best suited for repeating patterns partly due to the way its flinks
are best utilized on repeating patterns. The naive algorithm is a brute force failsafe and is at times better than KMP because it doesn't require excess
character comparisons in the form of building the flinks and works more efficiently on patterns without repeats.

The reason i believe the Boyer-Moore to be the best algorithm for any data set is because when running randomly in Testing.java, it was always the fastest algorithm
with the least amount of character comparisons. KMP and naive never have less comparisons than the Boyer-Moore, so even when they tie, the Boyer-Moore is still preferred
since it can be applied efficiently to other algorithms.

I will make one note here: When a pattern has a character that mismatches at the front of the pattern no matter where it is when aligned relative to the text, the naive 
algorithm will be faster since the Boyer-Moore will start analyzing the pattern with the text from the rightmost end of the pattern. This is the only advantage the naive 
has over the Boyer-Moore. This is demonstrated when running all three algorithms on the lec14a, where the naive algorithm has 16 comparisons for the pattern "10000" and the 
Boyer-Moore has 80 comparisons. I believe the Boyer-Moore could be improved dramatically if the algorithm can start its comparisons by first comparing the first and the last 
index of the pattern against the text, and if they both match, proceed with the Boyer-Moore algorithm as normal.

216.  For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly!
217.  The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally "rigged." Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!

252.  The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
253.  FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!
254.  The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!
255.  Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!

325.  Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
326.  I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!
327.  Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!
328.  The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!
329.  Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4:00 P.M. (prior to Super Bowl). Enjoy!
330.  Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?

333.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
334.  After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!
335.  The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
336.  Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!
337.  When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!
338.  Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!

352.  Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!
353.  Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!
354.  Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!

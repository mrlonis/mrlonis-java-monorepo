/**
 * This is the main entry point for the application. When run, a GUI will appear showing the cache table for a pair of randomly generated DNA strands.
 * <p>
 * Go ahead and experiment with different sizes in the constructor for SequenceAligner (i.e., replace the 12 with larger values).
 * <p>
 * Features of the GUI: Mouse over the nucleotides to see which character in which strand they each correspond to. Note that strand x is the vertical one in the leftmost column and
 * strand y is the horizontal one in the top row of the grid.
 * <p>
 * There is a context-sensitive menu attached to each nucleotide. Right click it to make the menu appear. Then you can select a new nucleotide for this position in the strand.
 * <p>
 * Once you have completed the methods in SequenceAligner to align the DNA strands, the aligned strands will appear in the control panel and you will be able to highlight the path
 * in the grid by selecting 'Show path'. Furthermore, each cache entry will show a tooltip that indicates the direction you take to get to its parent.
